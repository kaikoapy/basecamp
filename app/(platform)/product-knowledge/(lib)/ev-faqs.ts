      "There are three main ways to charge your Volvo EV:\n\n1. Level 1 (Regular Home Outlet): Plug into any standard 120V outlet. This is the slowest option, adding about 4 miles of range per hour.\n\n2. Level 2 (Home Charger): Uses a 240V connection, like what powers your dryer. This is what most people install at home, charging fully in 8-10 hours.\n\n3. DC Fast Charging: The fastest public charging option, charging up to 80% in about 40 minutes. This includes Tesla Superchargers, which Volvo can now use.",
    simpleContent:
      "Think of charging your EV as feeding your loyal pet:\n\n1. Small Snacks (Regular Home Outlet):\nLike giving your pet a nibble—enough to keep it going, but very slow.\n\n2. Regular Meals (Home Charger):\nLike serving a proper meal—plug in at night, and it’s ready to go by morning.\n\n3. Super Fast Treats (Fast Charging):\nLike giving your pet a quick energy boost when you’re on the go.",

Recommended Setup: Choose a 40-amp or higher charger for faster charging and future-proofing.\n3. Charging Time: A Level 2 charger typically gives you a full charge overnight (8-10 hours).\n4. Backup Option: Every Volvo EV comes with a portable Level 1 charger that plugs into regular outlets.",
    simpleContent:
      "Setting up home charging is like preparing your pet’s feeding station:\n\n1. Call a Pro:\nJust like setting up an automatic feeder, you’ll need an electrician to install your EV’s ‘feeding system.’\n\n2. Pick the Right Feeder:\nChoose a setup that’s big enough to keep your pet (EV) happy, even if it gets hungrier (future needs).\n\n3. Overnight Refill:\nPlug it in at night, and it fills up while you rest—ready for action by morning.\n\n4. Emergency Snacks:\nYour EV comes with a small portable feeder (regular outlet charger) for when you’re on the go.",

    myth: "EVs don't have enough range for long trips",
    reality: "Modern EVs can travel 200-300+ miles on a single charge",
    explanation:
      "With Volvo's EV range and the growing network of fast chargers, long trips are completely practical. Most drivers stop every few hours anyway for breaks, which aligns perfectly with charging needs. Plus, your car's navigation system automatically plans charging stops on long routes.",
    origin:
      "This myth comes from early EVs (2010-2015) that had ranges of only 70-100 miles. People remember these early limitations, but technology has improved dramatically since then.",

    myth: "Charging takes too long compared to gas",
    reality: "Most charging happens at home while you sleep",
    explanation:
      "While it's true that charging takes longer than filling up with gas, the reality is that 80% of charging happens at home overnight. You start each day with a 'full tank.' For road trips, modern fast chargers can add 200 miles of range in about 30 minutes – just enough time for a coffee break.",
    origin:
      "This misconception stems from comparing EV charging only to gas station fill-ups, without considering that EVs offer something gas cars can't: the ability to 'refuel' at home while sleeping.",
  },
  {
    id: "m3",
    myth: "EVs are more expensive than gas cars",
    reality: "Lower operating costs offset the higher purchase price",
    explanation:
      "While EVs often cost more upfront, the total cost of ownership is often lower. You save on fuel (electricity vs. gas), maintenance (fewer moving parts), and qualify for tax incentives. Many owners save $5,000+ over five years compared to gas vehicles.",
    origin:
      "People focus on the higher upfront cost because it's immediate and visible, while the savings are spread out over time. Early EVs were also luxury vehicles, creating a perception that all EVs are expensive.",

    myth: "EV batteries need frequent replacement",
    reality: "Batteries are warrantied for 8-10 years and often last longer",
    explanation:
      "Modern EV batteries are designed to last the life of the vehicle. Volvo provides an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty on the battery. Data shows that most EV batteries retain over 80% of their capacity after 10 years of use.",
    origin:
      "This concern comes from people's experience with phone and laptop batteries that degrade quickly, plus early hybrid vehicles that sometimes needed battery replacement. Modern EV batteries use different technology and are designed specifically for automotive use.",

    myth: "EVs aren't good in cold weather",
    reality: "EVs perform well in cold climates with proper preparation",
    explanation:
      "While cold weather can reduce range, EVs have advantages in winter: instant cabin heat, no cold starts, and excellent traction control. Pre-conditioning while plugged in (warming the car before departure) helps maintain range. Many Scandinavian countries are leaders in EV adoption.",
    origin:
      "This misconception arises from early EV owners experiencing reduced range in cold weather without understanding how to optimize their vehicle's performance. Media coverage often focuses on worst-case scenarios without explaining the simple solutions.",

    myth: "Charging at home will spike your electric bill",
    reality: "Most users see only $30-50 monthly increase in electricity",
    explanation:
      "Charging at home is much cheaper than buying gas. The average EV owner sees an electricity bill increase of $30-50 per month, while saving $100-200 on gas. Many utility companies offer special EV rates for overnight charging.",
    origin:
      "This fear comes from people calculating electricity usage based on their current rates without knowing about EV-specific plans, off-peak rates, or comparing it to their current gas expenses. The large size of EV batteries makes people assume charging must be expensive.",
