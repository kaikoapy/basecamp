    myth: "PHEVs aren’t worth it if you still need gas",
    reality:
      "PHEVs let you drive electric for most trips while having gas as a backup",
    explanation:
      "Most PHEV owners use electric mode for daily commutes and errands, saving significantly on gas. The gas engine is there for long trips or when charging isn’t convenient. It’s the best of both worlds: electric efficiency with gas flexibility.",
    origin:
      "This myth comes from comparing PHEVs to full EVs rather than understanding their hybrid capabilities. Many people don’t realize that short electric trips account for most driving.",
